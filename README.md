# GraphTheory
I began reading Introduction to Graph Theory by Gary Chartrand and Ping Zhang, and wanted to play with some of the things I learned and see if I can write them into code.

Graph implemented with adjacency matrices with the following operations
 * Generics
 * addEdge
 * removeEdge
 * cartesianProduct
 * isAdjacent
 * getAdjacent
 * degree
  * Directed:
    * degree
    * degreeInv
      * Number of edges ending at vertex
  * Undirecred:
    * degreeUndirected
  * size

Coming Up:
 * Search Algorithm
