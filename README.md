# GraphTheory
I began reading Introduction to Graph Theory by Gary Chartrand and Ping Zhang, and wanted to play with some of the things I learned and see if I can write them into code.

Graph implemented with adjacency matrices with the following operations
 * Generics
 * addEdge
 * removeEdge
 * cartesianProduct
 * isAdjacent
 * getAdjacent


For graph images I am using
